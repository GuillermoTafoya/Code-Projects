# Password-Locker-Tkinter-GUI
Made mainly with TKINTER and auto-py-to-exe. To enter the GUI you must first type the "MasterPassword" (default is 0000). 
All passwords must be encripted with 2 keys to avoid them easily accessed in the CSV (I'm aware of binary files, but I wanted to try something else). 
For some reason I was not able to make the pygame mixer work as an exe so there is no background music there.
Also if you want to play the song anyway, you need to insert it as .wav for the exe. 
The passwords will be copied to clipboard as inspired by "Automate the boring stuff".
